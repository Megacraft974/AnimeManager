# Anime Manager

This app is the product of my *very* selective lazyness.
I like watching animes, but I don't want to pay for it, so I made 20k lines of code to watch whatever I want for free.
I also want to change the name, but I don't have any good idea, please feel free to send me some suggestions!

## Installation

- Clone this repository

- ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
- Run the main.py file to run the app directly
- OR run the build_pyinstaller.bat to make an executable (in the /dist folder)

## Usage

You can search for animes by title.
Click on 'Download torrents', and click on your file.
Once it is downloaded, you can watch it using the 'Watch' button (duh).
There are various torrents client and media player supported, I might add a tutorial about how to set it up if this app become popular.
